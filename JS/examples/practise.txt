Example — Arrays

Write code for:

Find max number

Find min

Reverse array

Filter even numbers

Find sum

Sort array

Remove duplicates

Count frequency

Example — Functions

Function with no return

Function with return value

Function with parameters

Function that returns object

Function inside object

Arrow vs normal function

Callback function

2️⃣ Step 2: Build a Small Mini Project Using Only That Concept

This is the secret to gaining real grip.

Examples:
🔹 If learning Arrays

Build:

Movie list

Students marks analysis

Product filter

Shopping cart array logic

🔹 If learning Objects

Build:

User profile object

Employee record system

Product catalog

🔹 If learning Functions

Build:

Calculator

Reusable utility functions (add, multiply, formatName, etc.)

Mini projects remove confusion and give confidence.

3️⃣ Step 3: Solve 3 Real-Life Problems

Pick real scenarios from daily life and convert them into code.

Example

Problem: Your expenses of a month
→ Store in array
→ Write functions for total, average

Problem: User login validation
→ Use objects + functions

Problem: Convert form data into JSON
→ Practice object + JSON.stringify + JSON.parse

This builds practical real-time thinking, which is needed for interviews & job tasks.

⭐ Extra Tips: How to Get Strong Grip
✔ Tip 1: Write code WITHOUT seeing Google or video

Even if it takes time, this builds your logic.

✔ Tip 2: Explain the concept to yourself

Speak out:
“Array starts from index 0… return ends a function…”
This activates your memory.

✔ Tip 3: Write your own notes

Not full notes — just key points:

One line definition

Two examples

When to use

When not to use

✔ Tip 4: Try to teach someone

When you teach, your brain understands 2× better.

✔ Tip 5: Solve the same problem in different ways

Example:

Using for

Using forEach

Using map()

Using reduce()

This builds mastery.

📌 Summary

To get a strong grip on any concept:

🔥 Learn → Practice 5–10 problems → Build mini project → Solve real-life problems

If you follow this for:

Functions

Arrays

Objects

JSON

Return statements

Async

Promises

You will reach mastery very fast.
