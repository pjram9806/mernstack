Nodejs
------
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser (on the server, desktop, or even IoT devices).

It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient.

inbuilt modules
----------------
fs,path,os,http

3rd party modules
------------------
bcrypt,jwt


bcrypt
------
this is used for hashing the password(password)
while register bcrypt.hash 
while bcrypt.compare

syntax
------
const password = 'mypass123';

//hashing pwd
const hashedPwd = await bcrypt.hash(password,10);
console.log('originalpwd:',password,'hashedpwd:',hashedPwd);
    
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password,hashedPwd);
console.log(isMatch);

jwt
-----
json web tokens 

Used for authentication (after login, server issues a token to client).
Token contains payload (like user id, role) and is signed with a secret key.
Client stores token (usually in localStorage or cookie) and sends it in Authorization header for protected routes.

for every successfull login a token will be generated based on their 





User logs in successfully.

Server generates a token (signed with a secret key).

Token is sent back to client → client stores it (usually in localStorage or cookies).

For every request to protected routes, the client sends the token in the Authorization header (Bearer <token>).

Server verifies the token before granting access.

Important methods:

jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { expiresIn: "1h" }) → generate token.

payload: usually user ID, email, or role (never password).

jwt.verify(token, secretKey) → verify token validity and decode payload.



🔹 Cookies

Definition: Small pieces of data stored in the browser (client-side).

Who stores it? The browser stores it, but the server can set it via response headers.

Size limit: ~4KB per cookie.

Lifetime: Can be temporary (session cookie) or persistent (with expiry date).

Use case:

Storing JWT token.

Saving user preferences (dark mode, language, etc.).

Security: Can be made safer with flags:

HttpOnly → not accessible via JavaScript.

Secure → only sent over HTTPS.

SameSite → controls cross-site requests.

🔹 Session

Definition: A way to store data on the server-side that is linked to a user.

How it works:

When a user logs in, the server creates a session (object stored in memory or database).

Server generates a Session ID.

Session ID is sent to the client in a cookie.

On the next request, client sends Session ID cookie → server looks up session → identifies the user.

Size limit: Not limited to 4KB (can store more since data is on the server).

Lifetime: Exists until it expires or user logs out.

Use case:

Traditional authentication (before JWT became popular).

Shopping carts, temporary user data.

🔹 Key Differences
Feature	Cookies (Client-side)	Sessions (Server-side)
Where stored?	Browser (client)	Server (memory/DB)
Data	Small pieces of info (string)	Any user-related data (objects)
Security	Exposed if not HttpOnly	Safer (data never leaves server)
Size limit	~4KB	Large (depends on server)
Speed	Faster (no lookup)	Slower (server must query data)
Use	Tokens, preferences	Authentication, user session
🔹 In Modern Apps

With JWT:

We often use stateless authentication → token stored in cookies or localStorage.

No need for server-side session storage.

With Sessions:

Server must remember each logged-in user → good for smaller apps, but not scalable as much as JWT.

👉 Simple way to remember:

Cookie = Storage on client (like a sticky note in the browser).

Session = Storage on server (linked with a Session ID in a cookie).























smtp server 
-----------
smtp server is used to send otps to email by using nodemailer module with smtp.gmail.com & port no of gmail
smtp.gmail.com port 587||465
smtp.outlook.com 

to send otps via email there is a module called nodemailer module
npm i nodemailer
